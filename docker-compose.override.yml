# Development override configuration
# This file is automatically loaded by docker-compose and overrides settings in docker-compose.yml

#
# To use production image instead of building from source:
#   Rename this file: mv docker-compose.override.yml docker-compose.override.yml.disabled
#   Then run: docker-compose up -d
